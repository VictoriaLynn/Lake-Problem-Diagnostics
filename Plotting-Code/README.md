* `Attainment-Maps`: contains the Matlab code I used to generate maps of the probability of attaining performance thresholds for an algorithm.  For these, I used the results of the MOEAFramework attainment analysis generated using Analysis_Attainment_LakeProblem.sh as input data.  
* `Control-Maps`: contains the Matlab code I used to generate control maps of algorithm performance as a function of the number of function evaluations and the population size.  This code requires the algorithm parameter files, Latin Hypercube Sample files, and average or local reference set metrics files as input.
