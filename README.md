### Lake Problem Training (C++)

Copyright (C) 2014-2015 Victoria Ward, Riddhi Singh and Pat Reed. Intended for use with MOEAFramework and Borg. Licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Contents: 
* `LakeProblem_4obj_1const_Control.cpp`: C++ source code for the 4 objective formulation
* `MakefileLake`: makefile that compiles the lake model, Borg and the SOWs generating code
* `Random1000SOWs.cpp`: code written by Riddhi in C++ to generate SOW files for 9 states of the world
that may be specified on line 316 of the lake model code

To compile and run:


* Download the Borg source code. Put all Borg and Lake Source in the same directory.

* Type the following command `make -f MakefileLake` to compile Borg, the Lake Problem code, and the SOW generating code 

* Before you can use the lake model, you will need to generate SOW files.  This can be done simply by typing
`./Random1000SOWs.exe` and moving the desired SOW file to the directory in which you are performing the optimization.

* To optimize the lake problem with Borg use the following command

`./BorgExec.exe -v 100 -o 4 -c 1 -l 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 -u 0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1 -e 0.01,0.01,0.0001,0.0001 -n 10000 -f outputfile.set -- ./LakeProblem4obj_control.exe`

Also, note if running these on thecube the executable names will not end in ".exe".  Otherwise, they will remain the same.
